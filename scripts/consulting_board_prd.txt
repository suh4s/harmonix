# Risks and Mitigations  
## Technical Challenges
1. **Risk**: AI personality simulation may not produce sufficiently distinct or valuable insights
   - **Mitigation**: Start with highly differentiated personalities, conduct extensive testing with real user content, implement feedback mechanisms for improving personality models, develop comprehensive source material analysis techniques

2. **Risk**: Processing large documents may create performance issues or excessive costs
   - **Mitigation**: Implement document size limits, optimize processing with chunking strategies, develop progressive processing that prioritizes essential content

3. **Risk**: LLM API dependencies may create bottlenecks or unexpected costs
   - **Mitigation**: Implement robust caching, develop fallback processing strategies, establish clear cost monitoring and controls

4. **Risk**: Ethical and legal considerations around simulating real personalities
   - **Mitigation**: Develop clear disclaimer system, focus on public domain materials and educational/transformative use cases, implement ethical guidelines for personality development, secure necessary permissions where applicable, include cultural sensitivity reviews for historical personalities

5. **Risk**: Cultural misrepresentation in historical or international personalities
   - **Mitigation**: Collaborate with cultural experts and scholars, implement cultural context frameworks, provide historical context with simulations, establish feedback mechanisms for cultural representation improvement

## MVP Scope Management
1. **Risk**: Feature creep expanding the MVP beyond feasible implementation
   - **Mitigation**: Strictly prioritize features based on core user value, implement a staged release approach, establish clear criteria for MVP completion

2. **Risk**: Core experience quality sacrificed for feature quantity
   - **Mitigation**: Define quality metrics for key features, prioritize depth over breadth in initial versions, focus on perfecting the consultation experience before adding peripheral features

3. **Risk**: User adoption hindered by complex interface or workflow
   - **Mitigation**: User testing from early development, progressive disclosure of advanced features, comprehensive but unobtrusive onboarding

## Resource Constraints
1. **Risk**: AI processing costs scaling unexpectedly with usage
   - **Mitigation**: Implement usage monitoring and alerting, develop tiered service models, optimize prompt engineering for efficiency

2. **Risk**: Development complexity requiring specialized skills
   - **Mitigation**: Start with proven technologies where possible, create detailed specifications for complex components, consider modular architecture that allows specialized development

3. **Risk**: Maintenance burden of personality library and models
   - **Mitigation**: Develop systematic personality creation framework, implement automated testing for personality consistency, create tools for efficient personality management
