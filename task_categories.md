# ConsultantAI Task Categories

This document outlines the four main categories of tasks for the ConsultantAI project and lists which tasks belong to each category.

## 1. Foundation/Infrastructure

These tasks form the core infrastructure and technical foundation of the application. They must be completed first as other components depend on them.

**Tasks in this category:**
- **Task 1**: Project Setup and Architecture
- **Task 2**: Frontend Foundation (Next.js)
- **Task 3**: Backend API Foundation (FastAPI)
- **Task 4**: AI Processing Engine (LangGraph/LangChain)
- **Task 14**: Deployment and DevOps

**Implementation Focus:**
- Setting up core frameworks and libraries
- Establishing project structure
- Creating development environments
- Defining architectural patterns
- Configuring deployment infrastructure

## 2. Core Features

These tasks implement the primary functionality that delivers the core value proposition of the application to users.

**Tasks in this category:**
- **Task 5**: User Authentication and Management
- **Task 6**: Document and Idea Upload System
- **Task 7**: Personality Selection Interface
- **Task 8**: Consultation Session Engine Integration
- **Task 9**: Interactive Feedback Dashboard

**Implementation Focus:**
- User-facing primary features
- Critical user flows
- Core business logic
- Primary data processing
- Main interactive components

## 3. Enhanced Features

These tasks implement additional functionality that enhances the user experience but isn't part of the core value proposition.

**Tasks in this category:**
- **Task 10**: Project and Session Management
- **Task 11**: Export and Sharing Features
- **Task 12**: Basic Planning Tool

**Implementation Focus:**
- Secondary user workflows
- Content organization
- Collaboration features
- Data export and sharing
- Extended utility functions

## 4. Cross-cutting Concerns

These tasks address quality, performance, and compliance aspects that span across the entire application.

**Tasks in this category:**
- **Task 13**: Testing and Quality Assurance
- **Task 15**: System Resilience and Error Handling
- **Task 16**: Performance Optimization
- **Task 17**: Accessibility and Standards Compliance
- **Task 18**: API Management and Documentation

**Implementation Focus:**
- Quality assurance and testing
- Error handling and recovery
- Performance optimization
- Accessibility compliance
- Documentation and standards
- Monitoring and observability

## Development Strategy

The recommended approach for implementing these categories:

1. Begin with **Foundation/Infrastructure** tasks to establish the technical foundation
2. Implement **Core Features** to deliver the primary user value
3. Add **Enhanced Features** to improve the overall user experience
4. Address **Cross-cutting Concerns** throughout development, with increased focus as features stabilize

Each category should have dedicated time in the development timeline, and cross-cutting concerns should be considered from the beginning but implemented with increasing depth as the application matures.
