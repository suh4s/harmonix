# Task ID: 1
# Title: Project Setup and Architecture
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the project structure, define architecture, and establish development environment
# Details:
Create the initial project repository with appropriate structure for frontend, backend, and AI components. The root directory should be named 'harmonix' with frontend, backend, and ai_services directories created directly at the root level. Set up the development environment, configuration files, and documentation. Define the architecture that follows the PRD specifications and incorporates LangChain ecosystem (LangGraph, LangSmith, LangChain Hub), Next.js, ShadcN UI for frontend, and FastAPI with LangGraph for backend. Configure MCP for authentication and database access.

# Test Strategy:
Verify all configuration files are correct, ensure development environment can be bootstrapped by another developer, confirm project structure matches the planned architecture with 'harmonix' as the root directory.

# Subtasks:
## 1.1. Initialize Project Repository [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create GitHub repository with initial documentation and structure
### Details:
Set up GitHub repository with README, .gitignore, license, and contributing guidelines. Create initial folder structure with 'harmonix' as the root directory, containing frontend (Next.js/React), backend (FastAPI), and ai_services (LangChain/LangGraph) directories directly at the root level.

## 1.2. Configure Development Environment [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up development tooling and configuration
### Details:
Create configuration for linting, formatting, testing, and CI/CD. Set up environment variables, Docker configuration, and local development scripts. Include configuration for LangSmith observability.

## 1.3. Define Architecture Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create comprehensive architecture documentation
### Details:
Document system components, data flows, API contracts, database schemas, and deployment strategy. Create diagrams for architecture visualization. Document the integration between Next.js frontend, FastAPI backend, LangGraph workflows, LangChain Hub for prompt management, and LangSmith for observability. Ensure documentation reflects the 'harmonix' directory structure with frontend, backend, and ai_services at the root level.

## 1.4. Set Up LangSmith Observability [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure LangSmith for monitoring and debugging AI components
### Details:
Set up LangSmith project for tracking and monitoring LLM calls, prompt performance, and AI system behavior. Configure tracing and logging integration with various components.

## 1.5. Configure LangChain Hub Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up LangChain Hub for prompt management
### Details:
Configure project integration with LangChain Hub for managing, versioning, and sharing prompts across the application. Set up initial project structure in LangChain Hub.

## 1.6. Configure MCP Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up MCP for authentication and database access
### Details:
Configure MCP integration for handling authentication, user management, and database access across the application. Define access patterns and security boundaries.
